# Eventing Overview
>The eventing plug-in allows for the publishing and subscribing of events.  The
default implementation allows for publishing and handling of events within the
host's application process.  However, other plug-ins such as NetFusion.RabbitMQ
can extend this base implementation and publish and subscribe to events out of
process.  Regardless of how the event is delivered, the publishing and subscribing
is identical.
